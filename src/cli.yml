    First use tess module to generate initial tesselation,
    then use reg module to regularize that tesselation
    and only then mesh regularized tesselation with mesh module.
    
    Every time you use a module its last result is cached
    in ./tenspec-cache directory, so, for example, you don't need
    to generate and regularize tesselation multiple time to create meshes with
    different characteristic lengths.
